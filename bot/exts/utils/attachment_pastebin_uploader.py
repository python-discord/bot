    Handles automatic uploading of attachments to the paste bin.

    Whenever a user uploads one or more attachments that is text-based (py, txt, csv, etc.), this cog offers to upload
    all the attachments to the paste bin automatically. The steps are as follows:
    - The bot replies to the message containing the attachments, asking the user to react with a checkmark to consent
      to having the content uploaded.
    - If consent is given, the bot uploads the contents and edits its own message to contain the link.
    - The bot DMs the user the delete link for the paste.
    - The bot waits for the user to react with a trashcan emoji, in which case the bot deletes the paste and its own
      message.
