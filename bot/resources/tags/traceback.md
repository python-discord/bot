Please provide a full traceback to your exception in order for us to identify your issue.

A full traceback could look like:
```py
Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "tiny", line 3, in
        do_something()
    File "tiny", line 2, in do_something
        a = 6 / 0
ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero
```
The best way to read your traceback is bottom to top.

• Identify the exception raised (e.g. ZeroDivisionError)  
• Make note of the line number, and navigate there in your program.  
• Try to understand why the error occurred.
