<@!683001325440860340> is a bot that will relay your messages to our moderation team, so that you can start a conversation with the moderation team. Your messages will be relayed to the entire moderator team, who will be able to respond to you via the bot.

It supports attachments, codeblocks, and reactions. As communication happens over direct messages, the conversation will stay between you and the mod team.

**To use it, simply send a direct message to the bot.**

Should there be an urgent and immediate need for a moderator to look at a channel, feel free to ping the <@&831776746206265384> role instead.
