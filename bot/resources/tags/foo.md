    title: "Metasyntactic variables"
---
A specific word or set of words identified as a placeholder used in programming. They are used to name entities such as variables, functions, etc, whose exact identity is unimportant and serve only to demonstrate a concept, which is useful for teaching programming.

Common examples include `foobar`, `foo`, `bar`, `baz`, and `qux`.
Python has its own metasyntactic variables, namely `spam`, `eggs`, and `bacon`. This is a reference to a [Monty Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python) sketch (the eponym of the language).
