\`\`\`py
print('Hello world!')
\`\`\`

**These are backticks, not quotes.** Check [this](https://superuser.com/questions/254076/how-do-i-type-the-tick-and-backtick-characters-on-windows/254077#254077) out if you can't find the backtick key.

**For long code samples,** you can use our [pastebin](https://paste.pythondiscord.com/).
